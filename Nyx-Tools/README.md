## üöÄ Getting Started with NYX TOOLS

Follow these steps to set up and run the NYX TOOLS suite:

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher is recommended.
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.
*   **Node.js & npm:** Required **only** if you intend to use the "Discord Nuke Bot". LTS version of Node.js is recommended.
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).

**Setup Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the private repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Markhor-Nyx/Nyx-Tools.git
    ```
    (You will need appropriate authentication for a private repository).

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Nyx-Tools
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python libraries for the tools using the `requirements.txt` file located in the root directory:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: If `pip` refers to Python 2 on your system, try `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.*

4.  **(Optional) Setup for Discord Nuke Bot (Node.js):**
    If you plan to use the Discord Nuke Bot, you need to install its Node.js dependencies.
    Navigate to its directory and run `npm install`:
    ```bash
    cd discord_nuke_bot
    npm install
    cd .. 
    ```
    (This command should be run from within the `discord_nuke_bot` directory).

**Running the Tools:**

All Python-based tools are accessible through the main launcher script.

1.  **Run the Main Launcher:**
    From the root `Nyx-Tools` directory, execute:
    ```bash
    python main_launcher.py
    ```

2.  **Select a Tool:**
    A menu will appear listing all available tools. Enter the number corresponding to the tool you wish to use and press Enter.

3.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**
    Each tool will then guide you with specific prompts for required inputs (e.g., target domain, API keys, email details, etc.).

    *   **API Keys:** Some tools (like Phone Number Validator) require API keys. It's recommended to set these as environment variables or manage them securely. The tool might prompt you if a key is not found. Refer to individual tool notes or code comments for specific API key requirements.
    *   **Sensitive Tools:** Tools like the Discord Token Grabber and Discord Nuke Bot will have additional warnings and confirmation steps due to their sensitive nature. **Proceed with extreme caution and only with proper authorization.**

**Using in Termux (Android):**

The setup process for Termux is similar:

1.  Open Termux and install prerequisites:
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
    pkg install git python nodejs-lts -y 
    ```
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Markhor-Nyx/Nyx-Tools.git`
3.  Navigate to the directory: `cd Nyx-Tools`
4.  Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  (Optional) Setup Nuke Bot: `cd discord_nuke_bot && npm install && cd ..`
6.  Run the launcher: `python main_launcher.py`

    *Note: Not all tools (especially those interacting with desktop environments like the Token Grabber) will function identically or at all in Termux as they would on a desktop OS.*

## üìù Notes & Future Development

*   This is an ongoing personal project for learning and development.
*   Future plans include adding more tools and refining existing ones with enhanced features and better error handling.
*   Contributions are not currently sought as this is a private learning repository.
